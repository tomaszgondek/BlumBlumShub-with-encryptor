A simple code, really. It lacks proper error handling so when something is not right it just closes.
Made for introductory course on cybersecurity excercise.

1. Installation:
- clone it into VS and compile
- download .exe and execute

2. The path user provides can be both with or without "", so user on windows can just right click on file and select "copy as path"
   
4. There is no 3rd point

Enjoy
